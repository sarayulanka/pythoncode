# Files don't just have names, files have paths or ways to access and get to them
# and these are called file paths

# files live in folders, and folders can live in other folders
# The main folder or the folder that isn't located in any other folder is called the root
# It is called the root because it is the folder that is the origin or where any file or folder is located

# For example, in windows, usually c drive is the root because 
# it is the folder that isn't located in another folder


# The file path for file_paths.py is first go into c drive
# Then go into the Sarayu folder
# Then go into the programming folder
# then python folder, then python_with_angela_course folder, and finally day24

# This is the file path for file_paths.py


# Now there are two types of file paths: absolute file paths and relative file paths.

# Absolute file paths are file paths that directly start from the root,
# and relative file paths are the paths that get to a different directory
# with reference to the current directory

# So the main difference between absolute file paths and relative file paths 
# are that absolute file paths are relative to the root and relative file paths are not
