# In the previous file, we learned about scope, global scope, and local scope
# In this file, we are going to focus on global constants
# Global constants are just basically data storage types that you name that you will never modify
# When we are creating a global constant, we usually name it somthing in all uppercase
# This is to help us make sure we remember not to change the global constant
# Example:

PI = 3.14159
