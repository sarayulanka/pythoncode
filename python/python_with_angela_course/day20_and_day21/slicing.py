# Slicing is a concept that allows you to slice or take a particular fraction of a list or tuple
# The syntax for slicing is list_name/tuple_name[startindex: endindex]
# Let's try slicing a list below:

piano_keys = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g']
sliced_piano_keys = piano_keys[2:5]

# It's important to remember that even if you say c_index through f_index, f won't be part of the sliced list
# The sliced list doesn't include the end_index value

# So instead of Sliced_piano_keys conatining c, d, e, and f, it contains c, d, and e
# so it will slice c through e

# This concept of slicing can be very useful and handy in certain coding scenarios
# Also, as a reminder, you can do this to tuples as well as long as you don't modify the current list
