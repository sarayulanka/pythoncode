# Today we are going to apply all of our skills from day 1 to build a bandname generator

# Bandname generator code:

#1. Create a greeting for your program.
print(" Welcome to the bandname generator!")

#2. Ask the user for the city that they grew up in.
city = input("What's the name of the city you grew up in?\n")

#3. Ask the user for the name of a pet.
pet = input("What was the name of your pet?\n")

#4. Combine the name of their city and pet and show them their band name.
print("Your band name could be " + city + " " + pet)
