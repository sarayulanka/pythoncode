# Simple Print Function
print("Hello World!")

# Strings and String Manipulations

# \n: puts the rest of a string on a new line regardless of how it is displayed in the program
# example:
print("Hello World!\nHello World!\nHello World!")

# Now time to learn how to add strings!
# Like always, each will string will be in quotes
# In between each string you will add plus signs
# Example:

print("Hello!" + "My name is Sarayu!")

# But remember, any character can be a string
# So if a space isn't coming your sentence in the output, there are three ways to put it in

# First way:
# Add a space to the end of Hello! inside the quotes
print("Hello! " + "My name is Sarayu!")

# Second Way:
# Add a space to the beginning of My Name is Sarayu inside the quotes
print("Hello!" + " My name is Sarayu!")

# Third Way:
# Put a space is quotes and add them to the strings using another plus sign
print("Hello!" + " " + "My name is Sarayu!")

# These are the three ways of how to add a space when combining string
# And that is how you add a string!


# Time To Practice Debugging!
# Fix This Code!
